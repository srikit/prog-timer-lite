# Programmable Timer Module - Lite Version

Programmable timer lite is a miniature, USB programmable timer module. This module can handle more than 100 alarm configurations and trigger the output channel based on the programmed conditions. The timer module can program using SRIKit's *Timer Programmer* software. 

This module is designed around the *STM8S001J3M* microcontroller and *DS3231* real-time clock. *AMS1117-3.3* regulator in this module can handle a maximum of 9V DC input without installing an external heatsink. 

The alarm terminal of this module is available as an open-collector output. 

This module is specifically developed to handle long-duration alarm configurations which can span up to years.
